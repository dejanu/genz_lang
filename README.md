## Programming language 101 (a programming language has 3 core parts)

- Lexer (Tokenizer): breaks code in tokens (meaningful pieces)
- Parser: analyze token structure and builds a syntax tree
- Interpreter/Compiler: **Interpreter** (executes code directly) or a **compiler** (translates it to another language).

## Flow

The first step is scanning, also known as lexing, or lexical analysis. A scanner (or lexer) takes in the linear stream of characters and chunks them together into a series of something more akin to “words” (tokens)

The next step is parsing. This is where our syntax gets a grammar—the ability
to compose larger expressions and statements out of smaller parts
