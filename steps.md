# Steps to Create a Programming Language

1. **Define the Language Goals**
   - Determine the purpose and scope of the language.
   - Identify the target audience and use cases.

2. **Design the Syntax and Semantics**
   - Define the grammar and rules of the language.
   - Create a specification document outlining the syntax and semantics.

3. **Develop a Lexer**
   - Write a lexer to tokenize the input source code.
   - Ensure it can handle all defined syntax elements.

4. **Create a Parser**
   - Develop a parser to generate an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from tokens.
   - Validate the syntax according to the language rules.

5. **Implement Semantic Analysis**
   - Perform type checking and other semantic validations on the AST.
   - Ensure the code adheres to the language's semantic rules.

6. **Generate Intermediate Representation (IR)**
   - Convert the AST into an intermediate representation.
   - Optimize the IR for better performance.

7. **Develop a Backend**
   - Write a code generator to convert the IR into target machine code or bytecode.
   - Implement optimizations specific to the target platform.

8. **Build a Standard Library**
   - Create a standard library with essential functions and utilities.
   - Ensure it is well-documented and tested.

9. **Write Documentation**
   - Document the language syntax, semantics, and standard library.
   - Provide tutorials and examples for new users.

10. **Testing and Debugging**
    - Write test cases to cover all aspects of the language.
    - Debug and fix issues found during testing.

11. **Release and Maintain**
    - Release the language to the public.
    - Continuously maintain and improve the language based on user feedback.

briefly describe the steps for creating a simple programming language, be concise

create a doc file with the high-level steps for creatign a simple programming language

the language will be called genx, and it's going to be an interpreted language

enumerate type of intepreters

what is a grammar

the grammar is going to be a simple one, since the language is called genx, 
it's going to have statement,
for printing BET, for assigment CAP, 
for conditionals SUS and NOSUS. 
generate Backus-Naur Form (BNF)  for the this simple grammar
