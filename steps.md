# Steps to Create a Simple Interpreted Programming Language

1. **Define the Language Grammar**
   - Specify the syntax rules and structure of the language.
   - Create a formal grammar using tools like BNF (Backus-Naur Form).

2. **Lexical Analysis (Tokenization)**
   - Write a lexer to convert the input source code into tokens.
   - Define token types such as keywords, identifiers, operators, literals, etc.

3. **Parsing**
   - Develop a parser to analyze the token sequence according to the grammar rules.
   - Construct an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representing the hierarchical structure of the code.

4. **Semantic Analysis**
   - Perform checks for semantic errors (e.g., type checking, scope resolution).
   - Annotate the AST with additional information needed for interpretation.

5. **Interpreter Design**
   - Implement an interpreter to traverse the AST and execute the code.
   - Handle different AST node types (e.g., expressions, statements, control flow).

6. **Error Handling**
   - Design mechanisms for reporting syntax and runtime errors.
   - Provide meaningful error messages to help users debug their code.

7. **Standard Library (Optional)**
   - Develop a set of built-in functions and utilities to support common tasks.
   - Integrate the standard library with the interpreter.

8. **Testing and Debugging**
   - Write test cases to validate the language features and interpreter behavior.
   - Debug and refine the implementation based on test results.

9. **Documentation**
   - Create comprehensive documentation for the language syntax, semantics, and usage.
   - Provide examples and tutorials to help users get started.

10. **Optimization (Optional)**
    - Optimize the interpreter for better performance.
    - Implement advanced features like Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation if needed.
